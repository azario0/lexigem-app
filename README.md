- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/azario0/LexiGem.git
    cd LexiGem
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your API Key:**
    - Create a new file in the root directory named `.env`.
    - Add your Google API key to this file:
      ```
      GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```

### Running the Application
